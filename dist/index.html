        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi I'm Hanus, some people call me Hans which is technically wrong but I don't mind. I'm currently studying to make a living as well. This site is not done yet, but I plan to add a few things in the future. And to finish this off in a meaningful way, go find out how old Harsume Miku is because we're the same age.
